# Two Factor Authentication

This is on the roadmap, but hasn't been started, yet.  Since `feathers-authentication@1.0.0+` runs on PassportJS, we can now build on top of Passport strategies like this one: https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-totp. 

We would love for a community member to champion this effort to get it out sooner.  The Core Team will continue our efforts on other parts of Feathers, and will otherwise revisit this once other work is wrapped up.  Please reach out to us in the Slack `#authentication` channel if you'd like help getting started.
